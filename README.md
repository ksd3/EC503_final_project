# EC503_final_project
Final Project for Professor Francesco Orabona's Learning From Data (EC503) Class

We implemented a single-layer autoencoder, one-class SVM, K-NN, and Isolation Forests from scratch in MATLAB in order to detect anomalies in labeled Banking data and unlabeled Stock Market data. Our code, data, results, and report are present here.
